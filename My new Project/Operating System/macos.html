    <h1>macOS</h1>
    <p>In1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the "Classic" Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded "Mac OS" in 1997, was pre-installed on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. It was noted for its ease of use, and also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.
        The current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named "Mac OS X" until 2012 and then "OS X" until 2016. It was developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT. It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced, such as problems with memory management. The current macOS is pre-installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually. It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices – iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.</p>
